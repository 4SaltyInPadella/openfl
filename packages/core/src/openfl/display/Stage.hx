/**
	The Stage class represents the main drawing area.

	For SWF content running in the browser(in Flash<sup>Â®</sup> Player),
	the Stage represents the entire area where Flash content is shown. For
	content running in AIR on desktop operating systems, each NativeWindow
	object has a corresponding Stage object.

	The Stage object is not globally accessible. You need to access it
	through the `stage` property of a DisplayObject instance.

	The Stage class has several ancestor classes  -  DisplayObjectContainer,
	InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and EventDispatcher  -  from which it
	inherits properties and methods. Many of these properties and methods are
	either inapplicable to Stage objects, or require security checks when
	called on a Stage object. The properties and methods that require security
	checks are documented as part of the Stage class.

	In addition, the following inherited properties are inapplicable to
	Stage objects. If you try to set them, an IllegalOperationError is thrown.
	These properties may always be read, but since they cannot be set, they
	will always contain default values.


	* `accessibilityProperties`
	* `alpha`
	* `blendMode`
	* `cacheAsBitmap`
	* `contextMenu`
	* `filters`
	* `focusRect`
	* `loaderInfo`
	* `mask`
	* `mouseEnabled`
	* `name`
	* `opaqueBackground`
	* `rotation`
	* `scale9Grid`
	* `scaleX`
	* `scaleY`
	* `scrollRect`
	* `tabEnabled`
	* `tabIndex`
	* `transform`
	* `visible`
	* `x`
	* `y`


	Some events that you might expect to be a part of the Stage class, such
	as `enterFrame`, `exitFrame`,
	`frameConstructed`, and `render`, cannot be Stage
	events because a reference to the Stage object cannot be guaranteed to
	exist in every situation where these events are used. Because these events
	cannot be dispatched by the Stage object, they are instead dispatched by
	every DisplayObject instance, which means that you can add an event
	listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for these events. These
	events, which are part of the DisplayObject class, are called broadcast
	events to differentiate them from events that target a specific
	DisplayObject instance. Two other broadcast events, `activate`
	and `deactivate`, belong to DisplayObject's superclass,
	EventDispatcher. The `activate` and `deactivate`
	events behave similarly to the DisplayObject broadcast events, except that
	these two events are dispatched not only by all DisplayObject instances,
	but also by all EventDispatcher instances and instances of other
	EventDispatcher subclasses. For more information on broadcast events, see
	the DisplayObject class.

	@event fullScreen             Dispatched when the Stage object enters, or
								  leaves, full-screen mode. A change in
								  full-screen mode can be initiated through
								  ActionScript, or the user invoking a keyboard
								  shortcut, or if the current focus leaves the
								  full-screen window.
	@event mouseLeave             Dispatched by the Stage object when the
								  pointer moves out of the stage area. If the
								  mouse button is pressed, the event is not
								  dispatched.
	@event orientationChange      Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
								  orientation changes.

								  Orientation changes can occur when the
								  user rotates the device, opens a slide-out
								  keyboard, or when the
								  `setAspectRatio()` is called.

								  **Note:** If the
								  `autoOrients` property is
								  `false`, then the stage
								  orientation does not change when a device is
								  rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
								  only dispatched for device rotation when
								  `autoOrients` is
								  `true`.
	@event orientationChanging    Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
								  orientation begins changing.

								  **Important:** orientationChanging
								  events are not dispatched on Android
								  devices.

								  **Note:** If the
								  `autoOrients` property is
								  `false`, then the stage
								  orientation does not change when a device is
								  rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
								  only dispatched for device rotation when
								  `autoOrients` is
								  `true`.
	@event resize                 Dispatched when the `scaleMode`
								  property of the Stage object is set to
								  `StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE` and the
								  SWF file is resized.
	@event stageVideoAvailability Dispatched by the Stage object when the state
								  of the stageVideos property changes.

		Use the `Stage.colorCorrectionSupport` property to determine if color
		correction is available on the current system and the default state. .
		If color correction is available, all colors on the stage are assumed
		to be in the sRGB color space, which is the most standard color space.
		Source profiles of input devices are not considered during color
		correction. No input color correction is applied; only the stage
		output is mapped to the main monitor's ICC color profile.

		In general, the benefits of activating color management include
		predictable and consistent color, better conversion, accurate proofing
		and more efficient cross-media output. Be aware, though, that color
		management does not provide perfect conversions due to devices having
		a different gamut from each other or original images. Nor does color
		management eliminate the need for custom or edited profiles. Color
		profiles are dependent on browsers, operating systems (OS), OS
		extensions, output devices, and application support.

		Applying color correction degrades the Flash runtime performance. A

		* `StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE` Sets the AIR
		application to expand the stage over the user's entire screen, with
		keyboard input allowed.(Not available for content running in Flash
		Player.)
		* `StageDisplayState.NORMAL` Sets the Flash runtime back to
		the standard stage display mode.


		The scaling behavior of the movie in full-screen mode is determined by
		the `scaleMode` setting(set using the
		`Stage.scaleMode` property or the SWF file's `embed`
		tag settings in the HTML file). If the `scaleMode` property is
		set to `noScale` while the application transitions to
		full-screen mode, the Stage `width` and `height`
		properties are updated, and the Stage dispatches a `resize`
		event. If any other scale mode is set, the stage and its contents are
		scaled to fill the new screen dimensions. The Stage object retains its
		original `width` and `height` values and does not
		dispatch a `resize` event.

		The following restrictions apply to SWF files that play within an HTML
		page(not those using the stand-alone Flash Player or not running in the
		AIR runtime):


		* To enable full-screen mode, add the `allowFullScreen`
		parameter to the `object` and `embed` tags in the
		HTML page that includes the SWF file, with `allowFullScreen`
		set to `"true"`, as shown in the following example:
		* Full-screen mode is initiated in response to a mouse click or key
		press by the user; the movie cannot change `Stage.displayState`
		without user input. Flash runtimes restrict keyboard input in full-screen
		mode. Acceptable keys include keyboard shortcuts that terminate
		full-screen mode and non-printing keys such as arrows, space, Shift, and
		Tab keys. Keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode are: Escape
		(Windows, Linux, and Mac), Control+W(Windows), Command+W(Mac), and
		Alt+F4.

		A Flash runtime dialog box appears over the movie when users enter
		full-screen mode to inform the users they are in full-screen mode and that
		they can press the Escape key to end full-screen mode.

		* Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, full-screen works the same in
		windowless mode as it does in window mode. If you set the Window Mode
		(`wmode` in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless
		(`opaque`) or Transparent Windowless
		(`transparent`), full-screen can be initiated, but the
		full-screen window will always be opaque.

		These restrictions are _not_ present for SWF content running in
		the stand-alone Flash Player or in AIR. AIR supports an interactive
		full-screen mode which allows keyboard input.

		For AIR content running in full-screen mode, the system screen saver
		and power saving options are disabled while video content is playing and
		until either the video stops or full-screen mode is exited.

		On Linux, setting `displayState` to
		`StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN` or
		`StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE` is an asynchronous
		operation.

		* `StageQuality.MEDIUM` - Medium rendering quality.

		* `StageQuality.BEST` - Very high rendering quality.
		Graphics are anti-aliased using a 4 x 4 pixel grid. If

		quality downscale algorithm that produces fewer artifacts(however, using
		`StageQuality.BEST` with `Bitmap.smoothing` set to
		`true` slows performance significantly and is not a recommended
		setting).


		Higher quality settings produce better rendering of scaled bitmaps.
		However, higher quality settings are computationally more expensive. In

		reduce the frame rate.

		value on mobile devices is `StageQuality.MEDIUM`.

		A list of StageVideo objects available for playing external videos.
		You can use only a limited number of StageVideo objects at a time.
		When a SWF begins to run, the number of available StageVideo objects
		depends on the platform and on available hardware.

		To use a StageVideo object, assign a member of the `stageVideos`
		Vector object to a StageVideo variable.

		All StageVideo objects are displayed on the stage behind any display
		objects. The StageVideo objects are displayed on the stage in the
		order they appear in the `stageVideos` Vector object. For example, if
		the `stageVideos` Vector object contains three entries:

		1. The StageVideo object in the 0 index of the `stageVideos` Vector
		object is displayed behind all StageVideo objects.
		2. The StageVideo object at index 1 is displayed in front of the
		StageVideo object at index 0.
		3. The StageVideo object at index 2 is displayed in front of the
		StageVideo object at index 1.

		Use the `StageVideo.depth` property to change this ordering.

		**Note:** AIR for TV devices support only one StageVideo object.

		Specifies the current width, in pixels, of the Stage.

		If the value of the `Stage.scaleMode` property is set to
		`StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE` when the user resizes the window, the
		Stage content maintains its defined size while the `stageWidth`
		property changes to reflect the new width size of the screen area occupied
		by the SWF file.(In the other scale modes, the `stageWidth`
		property always reflects the original width of the SWF file.) You can add
		an event listener for the `resize` event and then use the
		`stageWidth` property of the Stage class to determine the
		actual pixel dimension of the resized Flash runtime window. The event
		listener allows you to control how the screen content adjusts when the
		user resizes the window.

		Air for TV devices have slightly different behavior than desktop
		devices when you set the `stageWidth` property. If the
		`Stage.scaleMode` property is set to
		`StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE` and you set the
		`stageWidth` property, the stage width does not change until
		the next frame of the SWF.

		**Note:** In an HTML page hosting the SWF file, both the
		`object` and `embed` tags' `width`
		attributes must be set to a percentage(such as `100%`), not
		pixels. If the settings are generated by JavaScript code, the
		`width` parameter of the `AC_FL_RunContent() `
		method must be set to a percentage, too. This percentage is applied to the
		`stageWidth` value.

		@throws SecurityError Calling the `stageWidth` property of a
							  Stage object throws an exception for any caller that
							  is not in the same security sandbox as the Stage
							  owner (the main SWF file). To avoid this, the Stage
							  owner can grant permission to the domain of the
							  caller by calling the
							  `Security.allowDomain()` method or the

		Indicates whether GPU compositing is available and in use. The
		`wmodeGPU` value is `true` _only_ when all three of the following
		conditions exist:
		* GPU compositing has been requested.
		* GPU compositing is available.
		* GPU compositing is in use.

		Specifically, the `wmodeGPU` property indicates one of the following:

		1. GPU compositing has not been requested or is unavailable. In this
		case, the `wmodeGPU` property value is `false`.
		2. GPU compositing has been requested (if applicable and available),
		but the environment is operating in "fallback mode" (not optimal
		rendering) due to limitations of the content. In this case, the
		`wmodeGPU` property value is `true`.
		3. GPU compositing has been requested (if applicable and available),
		and the environment is operating in the best mode. In this case, the
		`wmodeGPU` property value is also `true`.

		In other words, the `wmodeGPU` property identifies the capability and
		state of the rendering environment. For runtimes that do not support
		GPU compositing, such as AIR 1.5.2, the value is always `false`,
		because (as stated above) the value is `true` only when GPU
		compositing has been requested, is available, and is in use.

		The `wmodeGPU` property is useful to determine, at runtime, whether or
		not GPU compositing is in use. The value of `wmodeGPU` indicates if
		your content is going to be scaled by hardware, or not, so you can
		present graphics at the correct size. You can also determine if you're
		rendering in a fast path or not, so that you can adjust your content
		complexity accordingly.

		For Flash Player in a browser, GPU compositing can be requested by the
		value of `gpu` for the `wmode` HTML parameter in the page hosting the
		SWF file. For other configurations, GPU compositing can be requested
		in the header of a SWF file (set using SWF authoring tools).

		However, the `wmodeGPU` property does not identify the current
		rendering performance. Even if GPU compositing is "in use" the
		rendering process might not be operating in the best mode. To adjust
		your content for optimal rendering, use a Flash runtime debugger
		version, and set the `DisplayGPUBlendsetting` in your mm.cfg file.

		**Note:** This property is always `false` when referenced from
		ActionScript that runs before the runtime performs its first rendering
		pass. For example, if you examine `wmodeGPU` from a script in Frame 1
		of Adobe Flash Professional, and your SWF file is the first SWF file
		loaded in a new instance of the runtime, then the `wmodeGPU` value is
		`false`. To get an accurate value, wait until at least one rendering
		pass has occurred. If you write an event listener for the `exitFrame`
		event of any `DisplayObject`, the `wmodeGPU` value at is the correct
		value.

		Calling the `invalidate()` method signals Flash runtimes to
		alert display objects on the next opportunity it has to render the display
		list(for example, when the playhead advances to a new frame). After you
		call the `invalidate()` method, when the display list is next
		rendered, the Flash runtime sends a `render` event to each
		display object that has registered to listen for the `render`
		event. You must call the `invalidate()` method each time you
		want the Flash runtime to send `render` events.

		The `render` event gives you an opportunity to make changes
		to the display list immediately before it is actually rendered. This lets
		you defer updates to the display list until the latest opportunity. This
		can increase performance by eliminating unnecessary screen updates.

		The `render` event is dispatched only to display objects
		that are in the same security domain as the code that calls the
		`stage.invalidate()` method, or to display objects from a
		security domain that has been granted permission via the
		`Security.allowDomain()` method.
